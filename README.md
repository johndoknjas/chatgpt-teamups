Some programs where the code was mainly written by Chat GPT, while I provided design specs and iterative feedback on how to revise the code.

How to run:
  - The friends lists simulator:
    - python3 main.py w x y z
      - Where w is the number of players to simulate on a server, x is the number of players to generate friends lists for, and y and z are the bounds for the random size of each friend list.
      - This simulation will output the percentage of the server that is in at least one of the x players' friends lists.
